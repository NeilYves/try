System Description
The SentroGlad: Centralized Barangay Registry Information System with Message Blast is a web-based application specifically designed to address the persistent data management and communication challenges faced by Barangay Central Glad. Developed using PHP for backend operations and MySQL for database management, the system ensures secure data storage, accurate recordkeeping, and reliable resident profiling. It requires an internet connection to operate and uses an API to send SMS-based message blasts, enabling barangay officials to disseminate announcements, advisories, and emergency notifications directly to residentsâ€™ mobile phones. By streamlining document processing and enhancing communication, SentroGlad improves administrative efficiency and public service accessibility. Furthermore, this research contributes to the growing field of e-governance solutions for local communities in the Philippines, offering a scalable and practical model that other barangays can adopt to modernize their operations and improve community engagement.
